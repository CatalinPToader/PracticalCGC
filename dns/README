The script takes 3 parameters, master_ip, slave_ip and domain.

For example, for the task
"Configure the host with IP address 192.168.1.1 as a DNS master server and the host with IP address 192.168.1.2 as a DNS slave server."
"Configure a DNS server on the master to resolve queries for the hogwarts.hp.com domain with its own IP"

you can run:
./setup_dns 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 howarts.hp.com

check by running on the DNS master VM:
host hogwarts.hp.com localhost


The script assumes that the VMs are reachable by SSH at student@<ip>. Change the username if needed.
Each SSH call will request the user's password (in the default VM configuration, it should be "student")

Check the output for errors. The user to which you connect by SSH should have sudo privileges (password may be requested?)
